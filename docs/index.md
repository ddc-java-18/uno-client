## Summary

[//]: # (TODO Below this comment include one or more paragraphs summarizing the purpose and operation of the Android app you propose to develop in this project.)

## Intended users & user stories
{: menu="Users" }

[//]: # (TODO Write a bullet list below this comment, including at least 2 different types of intended users. Make it reasonably specific; simply saying "Anyone who likes games" &#40;for example&#41; is not sufficiently specific. For each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_, formatted as a blockquote indented below the intended user bullet point. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence &#40;no more than 2 sentences&#41;, in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user performs using the app, and the benefit that will be obtained. )

<!--

Notes on user stories:

The simplest user stories take the form 

> As a <type of intended user (_who_)> I want to <use of specific feature or functionality (_what_)> so that <benefit (_why_).

Please avoid writing too much for the user story. In particular, if the way the user story is written makes it difficult to see the _who_, _what_, and _why_, then you probably need to re-write it more directly. (On the other hand, a user story should not simply be a re-statement of the intended user description.)

Here is one (silly) example of an intended user, along with a user story. Please note not only the conceptual structure, but the Markdown syntax used.

[//]: # (TODO Remove the heading and the example below, after you have created your own user stories.)

### Silly example of intended user with user story 

* People who like to use randomness in their decision-making.

    > As someone who enjoys randomness in my life, I use this app to flip a virtual coin or roll one or more virtual dice, so that I can base my decisions on randomness without having to carry coins or dice in my pockets.

## Functionality

[//]: # (TODO List &#40;using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant&#41; the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e., tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary]&#40;#summary&#41;, but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. )

## Persistent data
{: menu="Persistence" }

[//]: # (TODO Using a bullet list, list what content will be stored on the Android device. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained &#40;i.e., without connection to a server&#41; across multiple sessions of use.)

## Device/external services
{: menu="Services" }

[//]: # (TODO If the client component will need to access special services of the device &#40;e.g., sensors, contacts, messaging&#41;, list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services &#40;e.g., real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database&#41;, those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.)

## Stretch goals and possible enhancements 
{: menu="Stretch goals" }

[//]: # (TODO If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.)
